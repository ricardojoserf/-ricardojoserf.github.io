Hello there! My name is Ricardo and I am a penetration tester based in Madrid, Spain, with 9 years of experience. 

I studied Telecommunications Engineering Degree and a Master's Degree in Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid, where I worked 2 years as researcher. After that I have worked 5 years as penetration tester/red teamer in Indra, then Entelgy Innotec and now Siemens Smart Infrastructure (Siemens SI).

I have cybersecurity certificates such as OSCP, OSCE, OSCE-3, CRTE, PACES, CRTO, CRTL, GXPN and the five HackTheBox Pro Labs; and network and cloud certificates such as CCNA Router & Switching, Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900), Azure Security Engineer Associate (AZ-500) and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.


## About this blog

I decided to start a blog some years ago so I created one using AdminLTE and AngularJS and hosted it in Heroku, you can read the code [here](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/ricardojoserf.herokuapp.com) but the page is now down. Github pages is easier to manage so I moved all the posts to this new site and it works quite fine. 

I will write mostly about public tools I release in [my Github](https://github.com/ricardojoserf) or hacking techniques I use in my daily work, most of the times to have a reference of how I did it in the future.
