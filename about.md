Hello there! My name is Ricardo and I am a penetration tester based in Madrid, Spain, with 9 years of experience. 

I studied Telecommunications Engineering Degree and a Master's Degree in Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid, where I worked 2 years as researcher. After that I have worked 7,5 years as penetration tester/red teamer in Indra, then Entelgy Innotec and now Siemens Smart Infrastructure (Siemens SI).

I have cybersecurity certificates such as OSCP, OSCE, OSCE-3, CRTE, PACES, CRTO, CRTL, GXPN, GRTP and the five HackTheBox Pro Labs; and network and cloud certificates such as CCNA Router & Switching, Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900), Azure Security Engineer Associate (AZ-500) and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.


## About this blog

I will write about open-source tools from [my Github](https://github.com/ricardojoserf) or hacking techniques I learn... most of the times to have a reference in the future because I forget :)
