title: p-invoke.net - Website with P/Invoke definitions
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

This website contains most of the P/Invoke definitions from the now offline pinvoke.net, adding the link to the Microsoft documentation for each one.

The Gitbook is available at [https://www.p-invoke.net/](https://www.p-invoke.net/).

The Github repository is [https://github.com/ricardojoserf/pinvoke.net](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/pinvoke.net).

### Notes

- I did this to check some definitions in a quick way because I used pinvoke.net a lot, but there are more professional solutions like [CsWin32](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32).

- The website contains almost 2500 files, the limit for Gitbook, but pull requests are more than welcome (if a definition is wrong or if you want to add new ones).
