title: NativeBypassCredGuard - Bypass Credential Guard using only NTAPIs
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

NativeBypassCredGuard is a tool designed to bypass Credential Guard by patching WDigest.dll using only NTAPI functions (functions exported by ntdll.dll). It is available in two flavours: C# and C++.

Repository: [https://github.com/ricardojoserf/NativeBypassCredGuard](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/NativeBypassCredGuard)

The tool locates the pattern "39 ?? ?? ?? ?? 00 8b ?? ?? ?? ?? 00" in the WDigest.dll file on disk (as explained in the first post in the Refences section, it is present in this file for all Windows versions), then calculates the memory addresses, and finally patches the value of two variables within WDigest.dll: *g_fParameter_UseLogonCredential* (to 1) and *g_IsCredGuardEnabled* (to 0).

This forces plaintext credential storage in memory ensuring that from that point forward, user credentials are stored in cleartext whenever they log in and can be easily retrieved by dumping the LSASS process.

Using only NTAPI functions, it is possible to remap the ntdll.dll library to bypass user-mode hooks and security mechanisms, which is an optional feature of the tool. If used, a clean ntdll.dll is obtained from a process created in debugged mode.

The NTAPI functions used are:

- NtOpenProcessToken and NtAdjustPrivilegesToken to enable the SeDebugPrivilege privilege
- NtCreateFile and NtReadFile to open a handle to the DLL file on disk and read its bytes
- NtGetNextProcess and NtQueryInformationProcess to get a handle to the lsass process
- NtReadVirtualMemory and NtQueryInformationProcess to get the WDigest.dll base address
- NtReadVirtualMemory to read the values of the variables
- NtWriteProcessMemory to write new values to the variables

## Usage

```
NativeBypassCredGuard <OPTION> <REMAP-NTDLL>
```

**Option** (required):
- **check**: Read current values
- **patch**: Write new values

**Remap ntdll** (optional):
- **true**: Remap the ntdll library
- **false** (or omitted): Do not remap the ntdll library

-------------------

## Examples

**Read values** (**without** ntdll remapping):

```
NativeBypassCredGuard.exe check
```

**Patch values** (**with** ntdll remapping):

```
NativeBypassCredGuard.exe patch true
```
