title: Riello UPS Restricted Shell Bypass
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

During a pentest we found Riello UPS systems can have their restricted configuration shell bypassed to gain full underlying operating system access.

[Riello UPS systems](https://www.riello-ups.es) allow SSH access to configure the device, sometimes with the default credentials "admin:admin".

Using the "-t bash" or "-t /bin/bash" parameters it is possible to escape the restricted shell and get access to the operating system:

```
ssh admin@x.x.x.x -t bash
```
